## Prerequisites

- AWS CLI (v2.0+) configured with appropriate IAM permissions for resource provisioning
- HashiCorp Terraform (v1.0.0+) installed locally or in CI/CD environment
- AWS S3 bucket for remote state storage with versioning enabled
- AWS DynamoDB table for state locking and consistency
- Git for version control and collaboration
- (Optional) AWS CDK for specific resource types not well-supported by Terraform
- (Optional) pre-commit hooks for Terraform validation and formatting

## Getting Started

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/terraform-aws-infrastructure.git
cd terraform-aws-infrastructure

# Create and configure the S3 backend for state management
./scripts/init-backend.sh

# Install pre-commit hooks (optional)
pre-commit install

# Initialize Terraform with the configured backend
cd environments/dev
terraform init -backend-config=backend.hcl
```

### Infrastructure Deployment

```bash
# Validate the Terraform configuration
terraform validate

# Format the Terraform files
terraform fmt -recursive

# Check for security issues and best practices
terraform-compliance -f aws -p .

# Generate an execution plan
terraform plan -out=tfplan -var-file=terraform.tfvars

# Review the plan output carefully

# Apply the changes
terraform apply tfplan

# Verify the deployment
terraform output
```

### Multi-Environment Workflow

```bash
# For staging environment
cd ../staging
terraform init -backend-config=backend.hcl
terraform plan -out=tfplan -var-file=terraform.tfvars
terraform apply tfplan

# For production environment (with approval)
cd ../prod
terraform init -backend-config=backend.hcl
terraform plan -out=tfplan -var-file=terraform.tfvars
# Obtain necessary approvals before proceeding
terraform apply tfplan
```

## Best Practices

### State Management
- Store state remotely in S3 with versioning enabled
- Implement state locking with DynamoDB to prevent concurrent modifications
- Use workspaces to isolate different environments
- Restrict access to state files using IAM policies

### Infrastructure as Code
- Implement GitOps workflow with pull request reviews for all changes
- Integrate infrastructure deployment in CI/CD pipelines
- Run `terraform plan` in CI to validate changes before approval
- Use consistent formatting with `terraform fmt`
- Validate configurations with `terraform validate` and custom policy checks

### Configuration Management
- Use variables and locals for configuration to promote DRY principles
- Implement environment-specific variable files (terraform.tfvars)
- Leverage Terraform modules for reusable components
- Document module inputs, outputs, and usage patterns

### Resource Management
- Follow consistent naming conventions across all resources
- Implement comprehensive tagging strategy for cost allocation and resource identification
- Use default_tags provider configuration for consistent base tags
- Implement resource timeouts for long-running operations

### Security
- Store sensitive data in AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store
- Implement least privilege IAM policies for all resources
- Enable encryption at rest for all data storage services
- Rotate credentials and keys regularly
- Use security groups with specific CIDR blocks instead of 0.0.0.0/0

### Cost Optimization
- Implement auto-scaling policies based on actual demand
- Use Spot Instances for non-critical workloads
- Configure lifecycle policies for storage to transition infrequently accessed data
- Implement budget alerts and cost anomaly detection
- Tag resources appropriately for cost allocation
